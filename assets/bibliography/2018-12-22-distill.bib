	abstract = {Physiotherapy is the largest healthcare contributor after nursing and medicine and it is important to understand its employment characteristics. This study aimed to explore workforce trends for recent physiotherapy graduates, including satisfaction and motivating factors, and future career intentions. A self-administered questionnaire was provided to contactable entry-level physiotherapy graduates (2000-2004) from Curtin University. Of 256 respondents (62.9\%), 76.5\% were employed full-time. A total of 45\% of physiotherapists worked in the public health system; 79.3\% worked in cities; 92.2\% were clinicians. Top salaries were earned by those completing more continuing professional development hours, working privately, in rural locations and males. A total of 65\% (n = 118) of respondents believed they would leave physiotherapy within 10 years. The best aspects of working in physiotherapy were 'helping people', 'flexibility' and 'working in a healthcare team'. Major areas for improvement were 'remuneration', 'skill recognition' and 'marketing'. This study suggests serious implications for the future of the health; planning to avert shortages is essential.},
