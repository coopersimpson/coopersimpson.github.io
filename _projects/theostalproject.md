<a href="https://www.theostalproject.com">The Ostal Project</a> is the identity under which I output a variety of art. In essence it is an ongoing art project exploring a variety of mediums. I enjoy exploring the aesthetics of geometry, sound and the human form.

The Ostal Project was founded in 2015. Early on I focused my efforts on producing electronic music, over the years the project has since expanded to encompass a variety of mediums including computer graphics, virtual reality and more. To hone my skills I created a piece of art everyday for 600 days in a row from January 2018 to August 2019, this can be viewed on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theostalproject">instagram</a>. The project continues to expand through exploration of new mediums while keeping true to its vision, story and distinctive style.

In May of 2020, I began to explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> and the world of cryptoart. I applied for the <a href="https://superrare.com/">SuperRare</a> platform and was accepted. I minted my genesis piece on SuperRare in May of 2020, and have since minted and sold a variety of works on the Ethereum blockchain.

My process involves the use a variety of software packages, namely Houdini, Cinema 4D, Octane Render and Ableton.
