<a href="https://www.theostalproject.com">The Ostal Project</a> is the identity under which I output a variety of art. In essence it is an ongoing art project exploring a variety of mediums. I enjoy exploring the aesthetics of geometry, sound and the human form.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

The Ostal Project was founded in 2015. Early on I focused my efforts on producing electronic music, over the years the project has since expanded to encompass a variety of mediums including computer graphics, virtual reality and more. The project continues to expand through exploration of new mediums while keeping true to its vision, story and distinctive style.

In May of 2020, I began to explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> and the world of cryptoart. I applied for the <a href="https://superrare.com/">SuperRare</a> platform and was accepted. I minted my genesis piece on SuperRare in May of 2020, and have since minted and sold a variety of works on the Ethereum blockchain.

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

Blah blah, a bit more about process and software used. dot points?
